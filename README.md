## Armada

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arthurtaborda/armada.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arthurtaborda/armada)

Armada is a simple battleship game. It provides a bot to play in single player mode.

To start simply run:

`./gradlew run`

It was created as a way for me to learn kotlin and practice Test Driven Development and hexagonal architecture
